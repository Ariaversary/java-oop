FIX:
1. character limit to stuff like name, etc.
2. fix character checks (such as | in the normal fields) so that it only accepts alphanumerical data
3. fix the search orders functionn for both admin and staff so that it can correctly search (and output errors) when filtering by date
4. fix modify user and maybe the other modifies

SIMPLIFIED LIST:
1. ~~Program that creates users.txt and ppe.txt during start up.~~
2. ~~Program that creates the admin account on start up and have that admin be able to create more users with data.~~
3. ~~Program that creates the suppliers.txt file~~ and store details/update.
4. ~~Program that updates the inventory of items.~~
5. ~~Program that records the distribution/receiving of items in transactions.txt~~

6. ~~Program that tracks the items and prints it into a .pdf file~~
7. ~~Program that can search with a filter~~

1st Part Q.4 and 2nd Part Q.1



CURRENT ERRORS:

Delete Supplier Error Message: Duplicated Invalid IDs


What i should do next:
create the staff menu
create the distribution system in the staff menu
implement the current search methods into the staff menu INCLUDING supplier search, user search, hospital search
implement the add hospital and add supplier into the staff menu
implement search for the ppe items






IDEAS (By Oguess):

When Adding/Modifying Supplier IDs, if it is limited to 4 ids (1,2,3 or 4), have the program display available/taken IDs and have the error message correnspond to this as well
